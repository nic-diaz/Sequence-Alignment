Project Summary: 
The basic version of the sequence alignment algorithm 
runs in O(mn) time and O(mn) space. A dynamic programming 
algorithm is used to store the optimal alignment values into 
an array of size m*n. 

The space efficient version of the algorithm works by usgin a 
divide and conquer approach. The optimal value of the solution 
is computed across a forward and backward alignment of the strings.
Because you only need the previous and current column to compute the 
optimal values, only two columns are needed to compute the optimal 
alignment value for two strings, hence the program taking O(m+n) memory.
